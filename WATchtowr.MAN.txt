Cymon API:
We make calls to cymon with term queries using an ajax HTTP get request. 
These API calls give us the latest files in last 30 days that match our search cirterion. 
We are currently searching for APache, MySQL and Ubuntu since these are major components of LAMP stack and are security vulnerable.
Cymon returs a series of 10 reports as a JSON object which we parse to extract version information, timestamps and location info.

Server Demon:
-

Firebase:
The entire webapp lives and operates off of firebase. The major features are the databases, cloud functions and hosting which we use to display the HTML pages and serve the code.
The databases are written to directly usign the firebase.database.push method. We currently keep the following databases:
-Issues: Threats that have been associated with a server
-Threats: Processed Cymon calls live here. 
-Servers: Active user systems with unique IDs and version/location information
-Users: Assigned unique IDs and have emails to communicate 

Cloud Functions
ServerUpdate(); watches databases . for updates and initiates version comparisons. 
Mail			initiates an email to the user with details about the vulnerability.
